Consider making defun aliases for the different layers of an interface, e.g. defun-highlevel, so that documentation can be generated easier

For the ! functions that one can actually depend on the value being set, what do we do?  There should be a difference between "this function destroys its argument, and the argument isn't useful afterwards" and "this function modifies its argument, but can then be used".  Or maybe there shouldn't, maybe we just say if there is a ! you have to assign the result.
